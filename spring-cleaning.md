# Spring Cleaning

## Why?

* Backlog growth is faster than team's velocity.
* There are feature requests and small bugs which don't get priority yet are worth looking into.

---

## What?

* For a defined period (e.g. a week), the team works on well-defined issues.
* Each person selects the issues to work on themself.
* The topics can be very diverse:
  * a small bug which annoys you but is not critical
  * an improvement that you always wanted to implement but it never got priority
  * a CI pipeline improvement
  * an automation for a tedious activity done manually
  * a flaky test
  * an accessibility improvement

## Spring cleaning issue

* well shaped (we know what we would like to do)
* provides a clear, immediate user value (user = anyone: end user, developer, us)
* is feasible to be fixed within our spring cleaning week
* is something you'd like to work on ;-)

## Spring cleaning at bpmn.io & Desktop Modeler

* Started in 2020 and organized it 10 times so far.
* Happens quarterly.
* Usually takes a work-week.
* Voluntary.

## How to organize a spring cleaning week?

* Plan it at least a few weeks in advance. We don't want anybody to be surprised.
* (1st time) Find issues which are well defined and tag them with a `spring cleaning` label.
* Schedule a kick-off and the presentation. The latter can be followed by a retro.
* Cancel meetings for the week, including kick-offs etc. We want to get focussed.
* During the week, make sure the items are reviewed continously to not end up with a pile of PRs.
